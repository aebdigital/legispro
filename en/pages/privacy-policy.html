                <h3>Why do we process your personal data?</h3>
                <p>One of our main goals is to provide you – our clients – with quality legal services in the exercise of our profession. This requires close cooperation between us and you and a high degree of trust. We process your personal data to achieve this goal, so that we can provide you with comprehensive and unique services in the legal field, e.g., develop solutions for various situations, represent you in dispute resolution, contract negotiations, or help you in various legal cases. Within these processes, we must fulfill legal, contractual, or other obligations. Our effort is always and to the greatest possible extent to protect you and your interests.</p>

                <h3>What does personal data actually mean?</h3>
                <p>Your personal data is any information or characteristic based on which we know or can identify you. It does not matter whether it is direct or indirect identification. Identifying information can be a certain general identifier such as name, surname, date of birth, personal number, or online identifier. An identifying characteristic can be a certain physiological, genetic, but also psychological or cultural characteristic or trait that is typical for you. Personal data can also be information about your preferences, e.g., consumer or interest-related, relating to your person.</p>

                <h3>How do we obtain your data?</h3>
                <p>As an introduction to this section, we would like to inform you that according to the relevant provisions of Section 18 of the Advocacy Act, a lawyer (law firm):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>processes personal data of clients and other natural persons to the extent necessary for the purposes of practicing law and when processing personal data for purposes related to the provision of legal services always has the position of data controller according to Article 4 paragraph 7,</li>
                    <li>is authorized to obtain and process personal data necessary for the purposes of practicing law by copying, scanning, or otherwise recording official documents on an information medium without the consent of the data subject,</li>
                    <li>does not have the obligation to provide information about personal data processing, allow access or portability of personal data according to special regulations, if this could lead to a violation of the lawyer's obligation to maintain confidentiality according to the Advocacy Act (and in such a case we will not inform you about the processing of your personal data).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>If you are our client</h4>
                <p>If you are our client, we obtain your personal data primarily from you. The provision of your personal data is completely voluntary, however, in some cases it is necessary for us to provide you with legal services in accordance with the Advocacy Act as amended. In exceptional cases, failure to provide your personal data may result in refusal to provide legal services.</p>

                <p>In some cases, we also obtain your personal data from sources other than you, for example from public authorities, from publicly available sources, or from other persons.</p>

                <h4>How do we obtain your personal data if you are not our client?</h4>
                <p>If you are not our client, we obtain your personal data mostly directly from our clients, from public sources, or from public authorities (e.g., if you are an opposing party in proceedings). In this case, we may obtain your personal data even against your will (based on legal authorization and obligation to practice law and provide legal services in accordance with the Advocacy Act).</p>

                <p>We also obtain your personal data from your visits to our website www.legispro.sk. Collection of your personal data also occurs by filling out the contact form on our website in the scope of name, surname, email address, and personal data contained in the message.</p>

At the same time, if your personal data is transferred, it is carefully secured through appropriate security measures in accordance with relevant safeguards, especially through the use of standard contractual clauses.</p>

                <h3>What categories of personal data do we process and to what extent?</h3>
                <p>We process your personal data to the extent that is minimally necessary for fulfilling our obligations or pursuing our legitimate interests towards you and always within the given purpose. We do not require personal data from you that is not necessary to achieve the given purpose. We process your personal data to the extent of: name, surname, permanent residence address, date of birth, email address and telephone number. If the nature of the matter requires it to achieve a specific purpose, we may also process data on the type and number of your identity document, your personal number and other personal data.</p>

                <p>In certain specific cases, we may also process special categories of personal data in the practice of law, e.g., information about health status or other personal status, always only to a minimal extent and for the given purpose.</p>

                <p>In the practice of law, we have legal authorization to obtain and process your personal data necessary for the purposes of practicing law by copying, scanning or otherwise recording official documents on an information medium, even without your consent.</p>

                <h3>How long do we retain your personal data?</h3>
                <p>We retain your personal data in a form that allows your identification no later than as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which the personal data is processed. After achieving this purpose, we immediately delete your data. We may retain personal data for longer if it is to be processed exclusively for archival purposes, for scientific purposes, for historical research purposes or for statistical purposes to fulfill legal obligations. Throughout the entire retention period of your personal data, we take care of their protection.</p>

                <p>In retaining your personal data, we proceed in accordance with Resolution of the Presidium of the Slovak Bar Association No. 29/11/2011, which stipulates the recommended retention period for the law firm's case files and related documents, and thus also for the processed personal data, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the lawyer shall store the incoming and outgoing mail register for ten years from the date of receipt or dispatch of the last item recorded in the register after it has been filled;</li>
                    <li>the lawyer shall archive the inventory list for ten years from the date of its compilation;</li>
                    <li>if the lawyer keeps a list of clients and a client file protocol electronically, at the end of the calendar year, they shall create a printed form for the calendar year and store it in the office indefinitely;</li>
                    <li>the retention period for a client file is 10 years and runs from the day when all conditions for placing the file in the archive are met.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In accordance with the same resolution, we cannot delete a client file at all if it contains original documents that you have handed over to us. We also cannot shred and/or otherwise dispose of the following documents:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>a client file containing original documents handed over to the lawyer by the client;</li>
                    <li>protocols of client files and lists of client files;</li>
                    <li>a client file or part thereof which the lawyer is obliged to hand over to the state archive;</li>
                </ul>

                <p>It is not possible to shred a client file if any proceedings are ongoing before a court, state administration body, law enforcement authorities, or the Slovak Bar Association, which are substantively related to the content of the client file, or the subject of which was the conduct or omission of the lawyer in providing legal assistance to the client in the matter. In addition, we process personal data for a period determined based on various criteria as follows:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>for the period stipulated by generally binding legal regulations, in cases where we process your personal data in fulfilling our legal obligations;</li>
                    <li>for the duration of the contractual relationship, or the duration of pre-contractual measures, in cases where we process your personal data based on the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures;</li>
                    <li>for the duration of our legitimate interest, in cases where the processing of personal data is carried out for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party;</li>
                    <li>for the duration of the granted consent to the processing of your personal data, in cases where we process your personal data based on the consent of the data subject.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As a data subject, you can contact us at any time with a request to specify the exact processing period for your personal data.</p>

                <h3>Do we use automated individual decision-making and profiling when processing your personal data?</h3>
                <p>When processing your personal data, we do not use any automated individual decision-making or profiling that would involve processing your personal data by using personal data to evaluate certain of your personal characteristics or traits.</p>

                <h3>To which countries do we transfer your personal data?</h3>
                <p>We may also transfer your personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area for the purpose of our presentation and advertising, for which we use the services of Google, LLC, Meta, Inc. and LinkedIn Corporation.</p>

                <h3>What are your rights?</h3>
                <p>Your legal rights and, conversely, our obligations are:</p>

                    <li><strong>Right to access information</strong>: upon your request, we will issue a confirmation of whether we are processing your personal data. If we are processing your personal data, you have the right to access it, and we will provide it to you in the form you request. You have the right to obtain information about the purpose and legal basis of the processing of your personal data, as well as about the category, recipients, and retention period thereof.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to rectification</strong>: We will rectify your personal data or supplement your incomplete personal data without undue delay after we become aware of their inaccuracy or incompleteness. We always keep your personal data up-to-date and accurate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to erasure, or "right to be forgotten"</strong>: Upon your request, or to fulfill legal obligations, we will erase your personal data without undue delay.

In certain legal cases, we cannot proceed with the erasure of your personal data immediately, as we must respect the minimum legal retention periods, or we cannot erase your personal data at all, see the section of this document regarding retention periods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to restriction of processing</strong>: If you find that your personal data processed by us is incorrect, we will restrict its processing upon your initiative. We will also restrict processing if such processing is unlawful, you object to the erasure of your personal data and request instead the restriction of its use. If we no longer need your personal data, but it is necessary for you to assert your legal claims, we will restrict its processing upon your initiative. If you exercise the right to object, we will also process your personal data only to a limited extent. In these cases, we will only store your personal data or process it only with your consent, or for the demonstration, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or for the protection of the rights of other persons, or for reasons of important public interest.</li>
