In protecting them, we proceed carefully according to applicable law, in particular according to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter "the Regulation"), Act No. 18/2018 Coll. on personal data protection and on amendments to certain acts, as well as Act No. 586/2003 Coll. on advocacy and on amendments to Act No. 455/1991 Coll. on trade licensing (Trade Licensing Act) as amended and other applicable legal regulations (hereinafter also "the Advocacy Act"). In addition to the aforementioned legal framework, we also proceed in the protection of your personal data according to the Code of Conduct for the Processing of Personal Data by Lawyers, which was adopted by the Slovak Bar Association and which is binding for every lawyer and law firm. The text of this code can be found on the website of the Slovak Bar Association here: <a href="https://www.sak.sk" target="_blank">https://www.sak.sk</a>.</p>

                <h3>Why do we process your personal data?</h3>
                <p>One of our main goals is to provide you – our clients – with quality legal services in the exercise of our profession. This requires close cooperation between us and you and a high degree of trust. We process your personal data to achieve this goal, so that we can provide you with comprehensive and unique services in the legal field, e.g., develop solutions for various situations, represent you in dispute resolution, contract negotiations, or help you in various legal cases. Within these processes, we must fulfill legal, contractual, or other obligations. Our effort is always and to the greatest possible extent to protect you and your interests.</p>

                <h3>What does personal data actually mean?</h3>
                <p>Your personal data is any information or characteristic based on which we know or can identify you. It does not matter whether it is direct or indirect identification. Identifying information can be a certain general identifier such as name, surname, date of birth, personal number, or online identifier. An identifying characteristic can be a certain physiological, genetic, but also psychological or cultural characteristic or trait that is typical for you. Personal data can also be information about your preferences, e.g., consumer or interest-related, relating to your person.</p>

                <h3>How do we obtain your data?</h3>
                <p>As an introduction to this section, we would like to inform you that according to the relevant provisions of Section 18 of the Advocacy Act, a lawyer (law firm):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>processes personal data of clients and other natural persons to the extent necessary for the purposes of practicing law and when processing personal data for purposes related to the provision of legal services always has the position of data controller according to Article 4 paragraph 7,</li>
                    <li>is authorized to obtain and process personal data necessary for the purposes of practicing law by copying, scanning, or otherwise recording official documents on an information medium without the consent of the data subject,</li>
                    <li>does not have the obligation to provide information about personal data processing, allow access or portability of personal data according to special regulations, if this could lead to a violation of the lawyer's obligation to maintain confidentiality according to the Advocacy Act (and in such a case we will not inform you about the processing of your personal data).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>If you are our client</h4>
                <p>If you are our client, we obtain your personal data primarily from you. The provision of your personal data is completely voluntary, however, in some cases it is necessary for us to provide you with legal services in accordance with the Advocacy Act as amended. In exceptional cases, failure to provide your personal data may result in refusal to provide legal services.</p>

                <p>In some cases, we also obtain your personal data from sources other than you, for example from public authorities, from publicly available sources, or from other persons.</p>

                <h4>How do we obtain your personal data if you are not our client?</h4>
                <p>If you are not our client, we obtain your personal data mostly directly from our clients, from public sources, or from public authorities (e.g., if you are an opposing party in proceedings). In this case, we may obtain your personal data even against your will (based on legal authorization and obligation to practice law and provide legal services in accordance with the Advocacy Act).</p>

                <p>We also obtain your personal data from your visits to our website www.legispro.sk. Collection of your personal data also occurs by filling out the contact form on our website in the scope of name, surname, email address, and personal data contained in the message.</p>

                <h3>For what purposes do we process your personal data?</h3>
